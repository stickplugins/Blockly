# Blockly Integration Documentation for stick.education

## Overview
This document outlines the process of integrating the Blockly visual programming library into the stick.education platform. Blockly allows users to create applications using visual blocks that can be linked together to form logical sequences. This integration aims to enhance the educational tools available on stick.education, making it easier for students to learn programming concepts through a hands-on approach.

## Requirements
- Web Browser: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
- Hosting: The Blockly files must be hosted on a server accessible to the stick.education platform.
- Permissions: Adequate permissions to modify the stick.education platform's codebase.

## Installation
1. **Include Blockly Library**
   - Add the Blockly library to the project by including the following script in the HTML file:
     ```html
     <script src="https://unpkg.com/blockly/blockly.min.js"></script>
     ```

2. **Add Blockly Container**
   - Insert a `div` element where Blockly will be rendered. This should be placed within the right sidebar of the platform.
     ```html
     <div id="blockly-container" style="height: 480px; width: 400px;"></div>
     ```

## Configuration
1. **Initialize Blockly Workspace**
   - Use the following script to initialize the Blockly workspace within the container. This script sets up a basic toolbox with categories for logic, loops, math, and text.
     ```javascript
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
         var workspace = Blockly.inject('blockly-container', {
             toolbox: `
                 <xml>
                     <category name="Logic" colour="%{BKY_LOGIC_HUE}">
                         <block type="controls_if"></block>
                         <block type="logic_compare"></block>
                     </category>
                     <category name="Loops" colour="%{BKY_LOOPS_HUE}">
                         <block type="controls_repeat_ext"></block>
                         <block type="controls_whileUntil"></block>
                     </category>
                     <category name="Math" colour="%{BKY_MATH_HUE}">
                         <block type="math_number"></block>
                         <block type="math_arithmetic"></block>
                     </category>
                     <category name="Text" colour="%{BKY_TEXTS_HUE}">
                         <block type="text"></block>
                         <block type="text_print"></block>
                     </category>
                 </xml>`
         });
     });
     ```

## Usage
- **Interacting with Blocks**
  - Users can drag blocks from the toolbox into the workspace to start building programs.
  - Blocks can be connected by dragging them close to each other until they snap together.
  - Right-click on blocks to access additional options such as duplicating or deleting blocks.

- **Running Programs**
  - Implement a function to serialize the Blockly workspace to code in the desired programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
  - Add a button that users can click to execute the code generated from the blocks.

## Customization
- **Adding Custom Blocks**
  - Developers can define custom blocks by specifying new block types in the Blockly toolbox.
  - Custom blocks can be designed to perform specific functions necessary for the educational objectives of stick.education.

- **Styling**
  - The appearance of the Blockly workspace and blocks can be customized using CSS to better integrate with the look and feel of the stick.education platform.

## Maintenance
- **Updating Blockly**
  - Regularly check for updates to the Blockly library to ensure compatibility and security.
  - Test the platform thoroughly after updating the library to ensure that all functionalities continue to work as expected.

## Support
- For issues related to Blockly integration, consult the [official Blockly documentation](https://developers.google.com/blockly) or seek help from the Blockly developer community.

This documentation provides a basic framework for integrating Blockly into the stick.education platform, enhancing its capabilities as an educational tool. Adjustments and expansions to this integration can be made to better suit specific educational needs and goals.
